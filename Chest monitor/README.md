# Chest monitor


This program is used to see what items are in a chest that is attached to the computer to the left side while the monitor is to the right

With a nice little touch in the top right corner. there is a clock that shows the current time. and refreshes every 5 seconds(the same as the text for the chest monitor)

## How to use this?
Use a code editor of your choice(or put the code directly into the ccomputer in game)
connect your code editor with the computer and run the code.
a extra option(what i advise) is to put the code on a floppy disk(you know what that is?) to use it on multiple computers.
